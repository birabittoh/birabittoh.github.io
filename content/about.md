Italian male born in 1998; I've been programming since 2016 and I love it. I enjoy art in every form, including video-games, as well as every kind of humor. I usually hang around on Discord while programming stuff I'll probably never actually get finished.

While Italian is my main language, I can read and write in English. I'm a fast learner on any kind of programming language as long as it follows basic human logic.

BiRabittoh, my nickname, comes from the Japanese pronunciation of "B-Rabbit", as said in Pandora Hearts, which was the first anime I ever watched on the internet.

Finally, I love sending and receiving emails; feel free to use them for business inquiries or even if you just want to chat.
